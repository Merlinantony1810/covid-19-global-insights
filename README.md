## 🧠 SQL Techniques Used
The project uses various advanced SQL techniques to extract meaningful insights:

- **JOINs**: Combining data from different sources (e.g., case data and vaccination data).
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Temporary result sets to structure and simplify complex queries.
- **Aggregate Functions**: Functions like `SUM()`, `MAX()`, and `ROUND()` to compute totals, maxima, and averages.
- **Window Functions**: Used to compute running totals, such as the rolling count of vaccinations over time.
- **Views**: Encapsulating common queries into reusable SQL views for easy reporting and analysis.
